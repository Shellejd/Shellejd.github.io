            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Throughout my professional career I've previously held management as
            well as subordinate positions in industries such as real estate, marketing and sales and technology.
            Although I hold a BS in Business Management, I'm currently learning Full Stack Java in a bootcamp
            environment. </p>
            <p>I consider myself a people person and enjoy working with any ethnic or
                international background.
                I also enjoy learning, and I am a forward-thinking self-starter.
                Challenging tasks are enjoyable because they allow me to accomplish a goal,
                learn a new skill,or uncover a deficiency in my current skillset.

                <p>Staying active by engaging in healhty activities is a great way to stay active and enrich my mind
                    and body is one way I self develope. Travel is aalso a favorite activity of mine because it
                    affords me the opportunity to learn something new in a relaxing environment. Volunteering is one way
                    I give
                    back to my community to make a positive difference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My future goal is to utilize my newly acquired skills as a Software Engineer and continue to
                    development professionally using trending technological applications for a Fortune 500
                    company.
